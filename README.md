Blackcat Technical Test: RunLength Encoding
-------------------------------------------

Areas for improvement/further work:
1) Implement the "stretch goal" of storage to a database
2) On the results page, differentiate better between the user input and the result as well as decoded/encoded
3) Explore input validation, esp whether we wish to allow the "special characters" used as delimiters in the RLE pattern ({};) and if so how will they be encoded (e.g. standard Java / to mark special char)
4) Allow the 5 character threshold to be configurable, either within the web app or by the user
